In this blog post, we’ll briefly explore



### A short report on AI and its definition and how it different from traditional programming.

Computer Science is borad domain that consists of many sub-fields and areas, for example, Software Engineering (SE), Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each has its requirments and components and tools, and they share some altogther.

In this short report, I will briefly talk about two fields, which are Artificial intelligence and trdational programming. I will start by defining the AI and how it is working. Second, explain what difference between the AI and traditional programming.

Computer Science is a broad domain that encompasses various sub-fields, such as Software Engineering (SE), Data Science (DS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each of these sub-fields has its own requirements, components, and tools, while also sharing some commonalities.

In this report, I will briefly discuss two fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional programming. I will start by defining AI and how it works. Then, I will explain the differences between AI and traditional programming.



## The definition of AI

In traditional programming, we using one or more of programming languages, and every step must be explicitly defined by a human to meet the expected outcomes from the program. in this process, the program follows a predefined sequence of rules, logic and operations to achieve our desired outcome. To illustrate, for a given input, the output and behavior is always straightforward and predictable based on the code. New features or handling of new data types usually require significant re-coding. 

Recently, artificial intelligence has been receiving significant attention and has been involved in numerous advancements across various domains. For example, healthcare AI- based solutions such as. 

In contrast, AI programming, the process called training a model, where `training` instead of programming and `model` instead of program in the context of AI. in this process, we create a mechanism to emulate human intelligence by employing algorithms and mathematical operations and functions on a provided data through iterative processing to enable the machine to learn patterns from data to get a predictable outcomes from the model. During training, the machine processes the data through multiple stages, called epochs, learning various patterns and accumulating experience with each pass. at the end the model will got a powerfully ability to behave and making decisions on unseen data. The accuracy of the model outcomes varies depending on the quality of the training. a well-trained model yields high-accurate results, while a poorly trained model leads to less accurate or unintended outcomes. For example, if an AI model is trained to draw a picture of a black cat, but the data is poorly selected and the mathematical operations and functions are improperly defined, the result might be a distorted image—a mix of a black stone with a cat’s body but missing its head, tail, and feet—instead of the expected black cat. as The model exposed to more data, it can improve and adjust its behavior over time.



## AI limitations:
In the human brain, we recognize objects and make decisions based on our experiences stored in memory, and we depend on creativity in some situations. This is known as natural intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to simulate the human brain, which is why it is called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of the human brain in AI is limited to the aspect of learning from experience, not the aspect of creativity. AI mechanisms cannot be creatively operate for new situations or unseen data without gaining previous experience from data. We should provide data and  define the algorithms and operations of the learning machenaism. In contrast, even humans without any prior experience (like infants) can observe their environment and react dicrectly based on their observations in a complicated process.

Understanding why an AI model made a particular decision can be challenging, especially in deep learning, where models can act as "black boxes."


## the difference between AI programming and Traditional programming
 

those two techniques, AI and traditional programming have share in one point, they both should use a programming language to make the machine operate. The programming language is merely a tool to achieve your goals, whether you're working on traditional programming-based development or AI-based. 


In human brain we recognize objects, and make decisions based on our experiences in memory and and bing creative in some situations, we call it natural intelligence. while the AI is simulating human brain, that is why it called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of human brain is only on the part of learn from experience in human, not the part of creativity. AI mechanism cannot be creative for new situations or working without data. While, the human even if has no any experience (like infants) they can observe the environment and make reaction based on their observations. [press][jekyll-docs]

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
