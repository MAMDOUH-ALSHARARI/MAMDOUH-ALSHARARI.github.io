## INTRODUCTION

the attention for computer software was technically focused on traditional programming and design algorithms on this side for many years, However, in recent years, Artificial intelligence(AI) has been turned to be used publicly and the attention to AI and data science turned to the increasing demand of AI services from a wide range of people. For those unware of the difference of AI programming and traditional programming, this blog will illustrate fundamentally how AI and regular programming differ in their unique characteristics and use.

Recently, artificial intelligence has been receiving significant attention and has been involved in numerous advancements across various domains. For example, in healthcare sector AI can be leveraged in a number of ways, such as finding new links between genetic codes, powering surgery-assisting robots, automating administrative tasks, personalizing treatment options and much more. 


## Defining the Basics 
Before we consider the differences between artificial intelligence and regular computing, it’s worth taking a moment to define what these terms mean.  

Regular computing, often referred to as traditional or classical computing, uses algorithms to perform specific tasks. The execution and completion of tasks within regular computing relies on a set of predefined instructions being pre-programmed to allow for the processing of data and production of desired outcomes. To use a cooking analogy, you can ask the computer to bake a cake, but it will only be able to complete the task if you have given the computer the recipe to follow. Regular computing is reliant upon pre-determined instruction, and it will only produce a result if you have told it how to achieve said result. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are designed to mimic human intelligence. Machines learn, adapt, and make decisions based on data without explicit programming. Machine learning is a subset of AI that has gained prominence, emphasizing the ability of systems to improve their performance through experience, increasing the efficiency in which tasks are completed through repetition and exposure to said task. Using our cake analogy once more, rather than pre-programming a specific cake recipe, you’d feed your AI programme with multiple different cake recipes (this being the raw data). In response to the task ‘bake a cake’, the AI would generate what it thought to be the most appropriate steps to follow based on the recipes in the input data set.  


## the Key Differences between AI and Traditional Software

Computer Science is broad domain that consists of many sub-fields and areas, for example, Software Engineering (SE), Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each has its unique requirements, components and use.

In this short report, I will briefly talk about two fields, which are Artificial intelligence and traditional programming. I will start by defining the AI and how it is working. Second, explain what difference between the AI and traditional programming.

Computer Science is a broad domain that encompasses various sub-fields, such as Software Engineering (SE), Data Science (DS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each of these sub-fields has its own requirements, components, and tools, while also sharing some commonalities.

In this report, I will briefly discuss two fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional programming. I will start by defining AI and how it works. Then, I will explain the differences between AI and traditional programming.


## How Traditional program works?

In regular programming(often referred to as traditional or classical computing) we using one or more of programming languages, and every step must be explicitly defined by a human to meet the expected outcomes from the program. in this process, the program follows a predefined sequence of rules, logic and operations to achieve our desired outcome. To illustrate, for a given input, the output and behavior is always straightforward and predictable based on the code. New features or handling of new data types usually require significant re-coding. 


## How AI program works?



In AI programming, the process called training a model, where 'training' instead of programming and 'model' instead of program in the context of AI terminology. in this process, we create a mechanism to emulate human intelligence by employing algorithms and mathematical operations and functions on a provided data through iterative processing to enable the machine to learn patterns from data to get a predictable outcomes from the model. During training, the machine processes the data through multiple stages, called epochs, learning various patterns and accumulating experience with each pass. at the end the model will got a powerfully ability to behave and making decisions on unseen data. The accuracy of the model outcomes varies depending on the quality of the training. a well-trained model yields high-accurate results, while a poorly trained model leads to less accurate or unintended outcomes. For example, if an AI model is trained to draw a picture of a black cat, but the data is poorly selected and the mathematical operations and functions are improperly defined, the result might be a distorted image—a mix of a black stone with a cat’s body but missing its head, tail, and feet—instead of the expected black cat. as The model exposed to more data, it can improve and adjust its behavior over time.



## AI limitations
In the human brain, we recognize objects and make decisions based on our experiences stored in memory, and we depend on creativity in some situations. This is known as natural intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to simulate the human brain, which is why it is called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of the human brain in AI is limited to the aspect of learning from experience, not the aspect of creativity. AI mechanisms cannot be creatively operate for new situations or unseen data without gaining previous experience from data. We should provide data and  define the algorithms and operations of the learning mechanism. In contrast, even humans without any prior experience (like infants) can observe their environment and react directly based on their observations in a complicated process.

Understanding why an AI model made a particular decision can be challenging, especially in deep learning, where models can act as "black boxes."


## the difference between AI programming and Traditional programming
 

those two techniques, AI and traditional programming have share in one point, they both should use a programming language to make the machine operate. The programming language is merely a tool to achieve your goals, whether you're working on traditional programming-based development or AI-based. 


In human brain we recognize objects, and make decisions based on our experiences in memory and and being creative in some situations, we call it natural intelligence. while the AI is simulating human brain, that is why it called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of human brain is only on the part of learn from experience in human, not the part of creativity. AI mechanism cannot be creative for new situations or working without data. While, the human even if has no any experience (like infants) they can observe the environment and make reaction based on their observations. 

## Conclusion
Traditional computing remains indispensable in our daily lives, providing the backbone for routine tasks. However, the transformative capabilities of AI open new frontiers, enabling machines to not just process information but to comprehend, learn, and make decisions. 

A year on from the release of ChatGPT the relationship between AI and regular computing continues to become increasingly intertwined. 


## Conclusion:

The distinction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional software lies in their fundamental approach and capabilities. Traditional software operates based on predefined instructions, executing tasks as programmed. AI, on the other hand, harnesses machine learning and neural networks to simulate human-like reasoning, enabling it to adapt, learn, and make context-aware decisions. While traditional software is well-suited for static, rule-bound tasks, AI excels in handling complex, unstructured data and providing more dynamic, intelligent responses. The choice between the two depends on the specific use case, with AI offering greater potential for innovation and adaptability in an ever-evolving technological landscape.
