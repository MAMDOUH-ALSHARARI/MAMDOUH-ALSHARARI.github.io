Sometimes, the best way to explain something is by writing a story, and sometimes, the best way to convince someone about your idea is by stating the facts.

Sometimes, we take readers on a grand journey with our write-up, and sometimes, we just relay some basic information in a short and sweet paragraph.

There are so many styles of writing out there and if you really want to master the art of writing, you first need to learn these styles and pick one to get your message across.

In this blog, we will walk you through eight different types of writing styles and some tips that will help you improve your writing prowess. Ready? Let’s go.

 

List Of Eight Different Types Of Writing Styles
1. Descriptive Writing
People often assume that descriptive writing is about using fancy and flowery phrases. However, strong descriptive writing is much more than that.

Descriptive writing provides details about things such as an event, a setting, or a group of characters. More often than not, these writings are personal, short, and subjective.

The main goal of descriptive writing is to make the readers feel like they’re experiencing everything in the storyline themselves. For that, you need to provide a vivid image of the story to the readers.

You can use this writing style to set the scene and add some spice to your writing. However, make sure that you don’t end up overusing it.

 

2. Persuasive Writing
Let’s say you want to write a book about the significance of eating green vegetables. One way to convince people to adopt this idea is by using a persuasive writing style.

Persuasive writing is used to convince the readers to believe in an idea (and implement it). This writing style is grounded in logical reasoning and works well for appealing to the reader on an emotional level.

This writing style is usually used in advertisements, reviews, recommendation letters, cover letters, company brochures, business proposals, and opinion columns.

You can also use it to gain support for a noble cause, such as using environmental-friendly products or updating obsolete company policies.

3. Narrative Writing
It is very easy to bore a reader with facts, figures, and examples that they can’t relate to. That’s where narrative writing comes in. You might find it in novels, biographies, poems, memoirs, and more.

Narrative writing is all about stories, connecting facts, teaching without explaining, and helping readers relate to the content. It often has a very clear beginning, middle, and end.

Occasionally, writers also use flashbacks and foreshadowing as tools to engage with the audience, while some even use characters and dialogues to tell the story.

All in all, narrative writing is great for keeping the audience hooked till the end. After all, we all love stories and we’re hard-wired to pay attention to them.

 

4. Expository Writing
Expository writing gives the readers important information and instructions about a topic. It’s entirely based on facts and doesn’t include a writer’s personal opinions on the subject.

You can find this writing style in textbooks, newsletters, educational articles, business/technical/scientific writing, recipes, newsletters, and more.

As expository writing is all about facts and figures, it does not always make the best hook. However, as they say, there are exceptions to every rule.

For instance, if you begin your write-up with a shocking stat, it is bound to grab a reader’s attention. You can even use it along with persuasive and narrative writing, adding the power of logic to your stories.

 

5. Review Writing
This writing style aids the reader in deciding whether they should invest in a product/experience or not. It involves both subjective and objective thoughts in order to relay the authors’ experience.

Review writing doesn’t always include persuasive writing, as the reader might or might not recommend the subject matter for both factual and personal reasons.

Reviews could be about anything – be it books, food, movies, video games, theme park experiences, toys, restaurants, places, or even a movie character.

However, no matter what you’re reviewing, make sure that you describe the physical flaws (example: low-quality plastic), perks (example: easy to set up), and experiential opinions (example: a breathtaking view).

 

6. Technical Writing
Most of us don’t have the time to scour highly technical and scientific writings (instructional manuals, white papers, scientific papers) to get the information that we need.

Well, technical writing is here to save the day! It takes complex technical and scientific content – and simplifies it for the average reader. The purpose is to communicate knowledge and instructions in the easiest way possible.

You can use technical writing to educate your employees on how to conduct safety procedures, or to break down the research data into accessible text.

You can also use this writing style to teach consumers how to assemble a product, or to explain the complex product features to them. The use-cases are endless!

 

7. Objective Writing
The word ‘objective’ describes something that’s purely factual and not influenced by personal feelings. So, objective writing is something that can be verified through facts and evidence.

In objective writing, the author is supposed to remain neutral and unbiased and let the readers form their own opinions. In short, objective writing means sticking to facts instead of opinions.

This writing style tends to lack vagueness and is very to-the-point. For example, rather than ‘almost everyone voted for her’, it will be ‘83% of the residents voted for her’.

Another important thing that you need to keep in mind here is: try not to over-exaggerate your writing. Don’t use words like ‘always’, ‘never’, ‘really’, or ‘very’. They can make your writing appear weak.

 

8. Subjective Writing
Subjective writing is opinion-driven writing. It expresses feelings, opinions, beliefs, perspectives, and judgments – and lacks factual statements and evidence. Hence, it can’t be verified.

Subjective writing originates from the personal experience and observation of the writer, and it gives the reader an insight into the author’s thinking process.

This writing style often makes the readers feel like someone’s speaking to them personally. The words “I’, “you”, “us’, and “we are added throughout each line.

You can find subjective writing in personal journals, blogs, speeches during informal events, literary work such as poems and stories, social media posts, and more.

Now, let’s learn a few tips you can follow to improve your writing style and make sure that you’re sending a clear (and accurate) message that the readers can comprehend.

5 Solid Tips To Improve Your Writing Style
1. Be Direct
Do you know what are the two key aspects of good writing? Clarity and conciseness. Filler words, prepositional phrases, unnecessary adverbs…they simply take up space and weigh down the sentence.

So, a good rule of thumb is to say exactly what you mean in a direct, straightforward way. This will make it super easy for readers to engage with your ideas or your stories.

 

2. Use a Conversational Tone
Always write like a human, not a robot. Express the ideas with your own unique voice and try to avoid clichés. Your writing style should always reflect your personality.

Use the same tone that you do when you’re speaking, and modify it a little according to what you’re writing. This means, use simple sentences, easy structures, and natural phrases that a reader can easily grasp.

 

3. Choose Your Words Wisely
There’s an assumption that rich vocabulary makes you a better writer, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. You should choose words and vocabulary that are appropriate for your audience.

Always remember that you’re writing for people, and if someone needs to look up the meaning of a word before they read further, you are very likely to lose them.

 

4. Avoid Using Passive Voice
Every writer has heard this advice – use active voice and stick to the good old subject-verb-object structure. Why? Because passive voice creates complex sentences and is not a good way of delivering information.

Moreover, in active voice, the subject is doing something. This is certainly more appealing than the passive voice, where something is being done to the subject.

 

5. Keep Your Sentences Short
A wonderful way to make your writing better is by limiting the use of long sentences. Short sentences are way easier to understand – something that readers always appreciate!

So, avoid packing too much information into one line and make sure that every sentence conveys one thought or idea. The easiest approach is to break up a long sentence into two or more short sentences.

 

Wrapping Up
Having a clear understanding of all the different types of writing styles is essential. After all, the way you write expresses who you are and what message you are trying to put across.

Each writing style has its time and place, so make sure that you learn the nitty-gritty of all the writing styles before using them. Knowing when and how to implement a writing style can raise the value of your work.
