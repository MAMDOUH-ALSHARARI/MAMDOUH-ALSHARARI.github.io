A short report on AI and its definition and how it different from traditional programming.



for learners who start they journey in computer science field or IT,  they face that the computer science and IT dived to many domains and relate to multidisciplinary areas. This will make confusion for making the decision of seeking and speicalise in the right domain. two of The most common domains are artificial intelligence and software programming.

In this short report, I will briefly define the AI and how it is working and how it is different from traditional programming to  reduce the confusion for learners of making the right decision.


The definition of AI

Recently, artificial intelligence has been receiving significant attention and has been involved in numerous advancements across various domains. For example, healthcare AI- based solutions such as. Ai is the mechanism to emulate human intelligence by employing algorithms and mathematical operations and functions on a provided data through iterative processing to enable the machine to learn from the data. the learning mechanism is another name of model training. During training, the machine processes the data through multiple stages, called epochs, learning various features and accumulating experience with each pass. at the end it will got a powerfully ability of acting and making decisions for new data on same context it trained on. 

In the human brain, we recognize objects and make decisions based on our experiences stored in memory, and we depend on creativity in some situations. This is known as natural intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to simulate the human brain, which is why it is called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of the human brain in AI is limited to the aspect of learning from experience, not the aspect of creativity. AI mechanisms cannot be creatively operate for new situations or data without gaining previous experience from other data in similar context. We should define the algorithms and operations of the learn machenaism and provide data. In contrast, even humans without any prior experience (like infants) can observe their environment and react dicrectly based on their observations in a complicated process.



the difference between AI and Traditional programming
 

In traditional programming, we use a programming language and code each step manually to achieve specific outcomes, every step must be explicitly defined by a human to meet the expected outcomes. Fouthermore, the results acuracy depomds on how we define and desgin the steps to achieve the results.

In contrast, AI-based programming, produces results based on the machine's accumulated experience from data after training the model. The accuracy of these outcomes varies depending on the quality of the training: a well-trained model yields high-accurate results, while a poorly trained model leads to less accurate or unintended outcomes. For example, if an AI model is trained to draw a picture of a black cat, but the data is poorly selected and the mathematical operations and functions are improperly defined, the result might be a distorted image—a mix of a black stone with a cat’s body but missing its head, tail, and feet—instead of the expected black cat.


those two techniques, AI and traditional programming have share in one point, they both should use a programming language to make the machine operate. The programming language is merely a tool to achieve your goals, whether you're working on traditional programming-based development or AI-based. 


In human brain we recognize objects, and make decisions based on our experiences in memory and and bing creative in some situations, we call it natural intelligence. while the AI is simulating human brain, that is why it called artificial intelligence. The simulation mechanism of human brain is only on the part of learn from experience in human, not the part of creativity. AI mechanism cannot be creative for new situations or working without data. While, the human even if has no any experience (like infants) they can observe the environment and make reaction based on their observations.
